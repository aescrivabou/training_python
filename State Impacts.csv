58925,6,Drought in parts of the U.S. has affected growth of Christmas trees,"Drought has reduced the supply of locally grown Christmas trees in parts of the southern U.S. this season. Extra trees were being imported from northern regions to supplement regional trees, according to the executive director of the Real Christmas Tree Board. Drought in parts of the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest will also mean increased seedling plantings next year to compensate for lost trees.
Brownfield Ag News (Jefferson City, Mo.), Nov 24, 2023

The cost of live Christmas trees rose about 10% in 2022, largely due to inflation and drought, stated industry experts. Years of extreme weather, ranging from drought to excess precipitation, were expected to bring slightly higher Christmas tree prices in 2023, according to a report from Country Folks Grower, a business-to-business publication that serves fresh market and ornamental crops.

Corn and soybeans have gained in U.S. acreage, while HRW have endured a downturn in acres in many areas, leaving exports in this class less competitive on the global market. 
Drought has also affected the crop in consecutive years, contributing to lower crop prospects and this class being less competitive with other suppliers like Russia and the European Union.

With the sauce in short supply, some opportunists have bumped up the price considerably on Amazon and eBay. Some customers of a Filipino-fusion restaurant in San Francisco have noticed that customers have begun to steal bottles of Sriracha. People have also called, hoping to purchase a bottle of Sriracha from the restaurant. 

Food & Wine (New York, N.Y.), June 26, 2023

A shortage of the chili peppers used to produce Sriracha hot sauce were in short supply, so the company that produces the famous sauce will suspend sales over the summer. Customers learned in an April 19 email that all orders submitted after that date would be fulfilled after Labor Day.
Peppers used in the sauce are grown in California, New Mexico and Mexico, and weather conditions were deepening the chili shortage.

“As the western U.S. faces a potential third year of drought, it’s critical that Californians across the state redouble our efforts to save water in every way possible,” the governor said.
Fifty of the Golden State’s 58 counties have been in a state of drought emergency since July, and Gov. Newsom added the eight remaining counties and reiterated his call for water conservation of 15%.  The State Water Resources Control Board is also free to adopt emergency regulations to forbid wasting water.
State water officials announced that Californians had conserved just 5% of their water use in August, which was an improvement over July when water conservation amounted to 1.8%. Some parts of the state were conserving better than others.
Local water suppliers must implement their water shortage contingency plans at “a level appropriate to local conditions that takes into account the possibility of a third consecutive dry year.”
During the previous drought, Gov. Jerry Brown mandated water conservation of 25% in urban water use.

In 2021, 9.5 million trees died. From mid-July to early October, researchers surveyed almost 40 million acres of federal, state and private land. They found dead trees spread across 2.6 million acres.
The biggest increase in tree mortality was seen in Douglas fir trees. Three million dead Douglas firs were observed, an increase of 1,650%, counted across 190,000 acres, mostly in the central Sierra Nevada Range. 
There were 12 million dead white fir trees, an increase of 691%, across 1.5 million acres, and 15 million dead red firs, an increase of 242%, across 890,000 acres. The dead trees were clustered mainly around the Northern California city of Redding, also in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and surrounding areas.
Other years with high tree mortality rates were 2016 with nearly 62 million dead trees, 2017 with 27 million trees and 2019 with 15 million dead trees. 
The main cause of the tree mortality is drought, as about 80% of the state endured severe drought since the start of 2022, per the U.S. Drought Monitor.

Lakes Mead and Powell on the Colorado River have fallen so low amid years of drought that major water cuts will be needed in 2023 to lower the danger of supplies becoming too low for power production and continued water deliveries. The needed cuts may amount to 2 million to 4 million acre-feet in 2023, a top water official said during a Senate hearing.

Cooler temperatures in northern areas, along with skimpy fertilizer use, were contributing to delayed and reduced pasture and hay production. In recent weeks, the slaughter data compared to last year has been increasing as limited pasture and hay production has become more apparent. 
Drought in 2021 resulted in a 9% increase in the beef cow slaughter, compared to the previous year, and a net culling of 11.6%. Drought hastened herd liquidation in 2021, leading to a 2.33% reduction in the beef cow herd in 2021.

42917,6,Millions of trees continued to die in California's Sierra Nevada after end of drought,"Tree mortality in California exceeded 172 million trees since 2010. 
In 2021, an estimated 9.5 million trees in California died from insects, disease and drought, according to aerial survey data from the U.S. Forest Service. Significant tree mortality occurred in Fresno and Tulare counties last year. The slopes of the Klamath, Trinity and northern Sierra ranges are dotted with dead trees after 2021—these moister areas had no dead trees just a few years ago. Siskiyou County had the most tree deaths with about 10% of the total in 2021.
Nearly two-thirds of the tree deaths from 2021 were firs and often infested with fir engraver beetles. Sugar and ponderosa pine continued to die mostly from mountain and western pine beetles. 
Seventy-five thousand trees, including acacia and eucalyptus, in the East Bay perished in 2021. Scientists think that fungi in combination with drought may have killed the trees. Many trees died at the East Bay Regional Park District’s Anthony Chabot, Reinhardt Redwood and Tilden parks.

San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Feb 28, 2022

California suffered the loss of another 18 million trees since the fall of 2017, a substantial number, but fewer than the 27 million dead trees counted in the fall of 2017 or the 62 million dead trees documented in the fall of 2016.  The return to more rainfall and less drought has helped trees resist the bark beetles that have damaged and killed so many trees.  
Since drought began in 2010, more than 147 million trees on 9.7 million acres died.  The slowing rate of tree mortality was encouraging.  
Los Angeles Times (Calif.), Feb. 11, 2019

Trees continued to die in the Sierra Nevada more than a year after the end of California’s multiyear drought.  The U.S. Forest Service reported that 27 million trees died since November 2016, bringing the total of dead trees to roughly 129 million on about 8.9 million acres of land since 2010.  The trees were stressed and dehydrated by drought, making them more vulnerable to bark beetle infestations and other ills.
The density of dead trees was so great in areas that foresters closed roads and campgrounds to protect the public from falling trees.  Views in Yosemite and Sequoia national parks were marred by the spectacle of rust-colored trees, as were some stretches along the coast.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom included another 39 counties in his drought emergency declaration, which originally included only Sonoma and Mendocino counties. No mandatory drought water conservation targets were ordered, as was done during the previous drought, because Californians were using 16% less water than they did in 2013 as conservation had become a habit.

Warm temperatures melted the Sierra Nevada snowpack quickly, which was only 59% of historical average on April 1.
