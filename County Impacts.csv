The Department of Water Resources announced an initial State Water Project allocation of 5 percent of requested supplies for 2023. The SWP provides water to 29 public water agencies that serve 27 million Californians. Water allocations are frequently low early in the wet season due to uncertainty in hydrologic forecasting.

Oroville ended Water Year 2022 at about 400,000 acre-feet higher than the previous year. 
For the 2022 Water Year, the initial allocation was 0% on Dec. 1, 2021, with limited water designated only for any unmet human health and safety needs.

The March estimate was 75% of requested supplies. Water from the SWP is delivered to 29 public water agencies serving 27 million Californians and 750,000 acres of farmland. 
California Department of Water Resources (Sacramento), April 20, 2023

The State Water Project will deliver 75% of requested supplies as winter storms brought tremendous amounts of snow this winter.
Los Angeles Times, March 24, 2023

The California Department of Water Resources announced an expected water allocation of 35% from the State Water Project, up from 30% in January. 
The Associated Press (New York), Feb 22, 2023

The series of storms that brought heavy rain and snow to California have partially filled reservoirs, allowing the State Water Project to offer 30% of requested water supplies to 29 public water agencies that serve 27 million Californians. The initial allocation in December was just 5%.
California typically receives half its rain and snow by the end of January. Water managers will reassess conditions monthly during the winter and spring, and also consider snowpack data and runoff forecasts from February on.

The Department of Water Resources announced an initial State Water Project allocation of 5 percent of requested supplies for 2023. The SWP provides water to 29 public water agencies that serve 27 million Californians. Water allocations are frequently low early in the wet season due to uncertainty in hydrologic forecasting. In addition, the expectation is for a fourth dry year and continued drought in California. Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the State Water Project system, is just 55% of average for this time of year. Oroville ended Water Year 2022 at about 400,000 acre-feet higher than the previous year. 
For the 2022 Water Year, the initial allocation was 0% on Dec. 1, 2021, with limited water designated only for any unmet human health and safety needs. Last year’s final allocation was 5 percent plus unmet health and safety needs. Four of the 29 State Water Contractors ultimately requested and received additional health and safety water supply.

The State Water Project will deliver 75% of requested supplies as winter storms brought tremendous amounts of snow this winter.
Los Angeles Times, March 24, 2023

The California Department of Water Resources announced an expected water allocation of 35% from the State Water Project, up from 30% in January. 
The Associated Press (New York), Feb 22, 2023

The series of storms that brought heavy rain and snow to California have partially filled reservoirs, allowing the State Water Project to offer 30% of requested water supplies to 29 public water agencies that serve 27 million Californians. The initial allocation in December was just 5%.
California typically receives half its rain and snow by the end of January. Water managers will reassess conditions monthly during the winter and spring, and also consider snowpack data and runoff forecasts from February on.

The Department of Water Resources announced an initial State Water Project allocation of 5 percent of requested supplies for 2023. The SWP provides water to 29 public water agencies that serve 27 million Californians. Water allocations are frequently low early in the wet season due to uncertainty in hydrologic forecasting. In addition, the expectation is for a fourth dry year and continued drought in California. Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the State Water Project system, is just 55% of average for this time of year. Oroville ended Water Year 2022 at about 400,000 acre-feet higher than the previous year.

KTLA 5 (Los Angeles, Calif.), March 15, 2023

Harsher water restrictions took effect on June 1 for more than 6 million customers of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California who were asked to curb water use by 35%. The below normal winter snowfall did not refill reservoirs much, leaving the State Water Project offering just 5% of normal allotments. Water users in parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties are dependent on water from the SWP and especially need to conserve 35%. 
Los Angeles Times (Calif.), June 1, 2022

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California adopted water restrictions to reduce water demand. Water districts are offered a choice for conserving water: water outdoors just one day a week or water usage must be kept below some monthly allocation limit. The restrictions affect the district’s six million customers in Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties that depend on water from the State Water Project and do not take effect until June 1. 
Local water districts must determine how to communicate requirements to customers and enforce the restrictions. 
Los Angeles Times (Calif.), April 26, 2022

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California adopted water restrictions to reduce water demand. Water districts are offered a choice for conserving water: water outdoors just one day a week or water usage must be kept below some monthly allocation limit. The restrictions affect the district’s six million customers in Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties that depend on water from the State Water Project and do not take effect until June 1. 
Local water districts must determine how to communicate requirements to customers and enforce the restrictions. 
Los Angeles Times (Calif.), April 26, 2022

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has half of the water that it needs to serve customers in parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties, according to Rebecca Kimitch, program manager for MWD. Those customers have been asked to limit outdoor watering to one day per week.

Harsher water restrictions took effect on June 1 for more than 6 million customers of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California who were asked to curb water use by 35%. The below normal winter snowfall did not refill reservoirs much, leaving the State Water Project offering just 5% of normal allotments.

57223,6001,Drought surcharge for customers of East Bay Municipal Utility District in California,"The East Bay Municipal Utility District ended its drought surcharge on March 1 as winter storms refilled reservoirs. The 8% surcharge took effect on July 1, 2022, and was used to purchase additional water supplies and expenses. Since fall 2022, EBMUD has spent $19 million on supplemental water. Incredible precipitation has pushed EBMUD’s reservoirs to 82% of capacity. The drought surcharge has already covered drought expenses for the fiscal year, so the surcharge has been dropped. In 2022, East Bay customers used 32,000 fewer acre-feet of water than in 2020.
As of March, 2 2023, EBMUD remained in a stage 2 drought with a mandated 10% reduction in water use and other directives, such as watering outdoors no more than thrice weekly, no pavement washing, etc.
Berkeleyside (Berkeley, Calif.), March 2, 2023

The East Bay Municipal Utility District voted to add a drought surcharge to water bills starting July 1. The fee will be an 8% surcharge over the amount normally paid for water and is expected to bring in about $30 million in the next year.

57938,6003,Drought contributed to the deaths of 36.3 million trees in California in 2022,"Tree mortality in California rose to about 36.3 million trees in 2022, due to drought, insects and disease, per the U.S. Forest Service. In 2021, 9.5 million trees died. From mid-July to early October, researchers surveyed almost 40 million acres of federal, state and private land. They found dead trees spread across 2.6 million acres.
The biggest increase in tree mortality was seen in Douglas fir trees. Three million dead Douglas firs were observed, an increase of 1,650%, counted across 190,000 acres, mostly in the central Sierra Nevada Range. 
There were 12 million dead white fir trees, an increase of 691%, across 1.5 million acres, and 15 million dead red firs, an increase of 242%, across 890,000 acres. The dead trees were clustered mainly around the Northern California city of Redding, also in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and surrounding areas.
Other years with high tree mortality rates were 2016 with nearly 62 million dead trees, 2017 with 27 million trees and 2019 with 15 million dead trees. 
The main cause of the tree mortality is drought, as about 80% of the state endured severe drought since the start of 2022, per the U.S. Drought Monitor.

In 2021, 9.5 million trees died. From mid-July to early October, researchers surveyed almost 40 million acres of federal, state and private land. They found dead trees spread across 2.6 million acres.
The biggest increase in tree mortality was seen in Douglas fir trees. Three million dead Douglas firs were observed, an increase of 1,650%, counted across 190,000 acres, mostly in the central Sierra Nevada Range. 
There were 12 million dead white fir trees, an increase of 691%, across 1.5 million acres, and 15 million dead red firs, an increase of 242%, across 890,000 acres. The dead trees were clustered mainly around the Northern California city of Redding, also in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and surrounding areas.
Other years with high tree mortality rates were 2016 with nearly 62 million dead trees, 2017 with 27 million trees and 2019 with 15 million dead trees. 
The main cause of the tree mortality is drought, as about 80% of the state endured severe drought since the start of 2022, per the U.S. Drought Monitor.

57938,6105,Drought contributed to the deaths of 36.3 million trees in California in 2022,"Tree mortality in California rose to about 36.3 million trees in 2022, due to drought, insects and disease, per the U.S. Forest Service. In 2021, 9.5 million trees died. From mid-July to early October, researchers surveyed almost 40 million acres of federal, state and private land. They found dead trees spread across 2.6 million acres.
The biggest increase in tree mortality was seen in Douglas fir trees. Three million dead Douglas firs were observed, an increase of 1,650%, counted across 190,000 acres, mostly in the central Sierra Nevada Range. 
There were 12 million dead white fir trees, an increase of 691%, across 1.5 million acres, and 15 million dead red firs, an increase of 242%, across 890,000 acres. The dead trees were clustered mainly around the Northern California city of Redding, also in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and surrounding areas.
Other years with high tree mortality rates were 2016 with nearly 62 million dead trees, 2017 with 27 million trees and 2019 with 15 million dead trees.

57878,6009,Years of drought affecting California Christmas tree farms,"Just one Christmas tree farm in Calaveras County was open for business this season, selling the big trees that the area is known for as warm temperatures, drought and wildfires took a toll on other area tree farms. Rain and snowfall used to provide all of the moisture that newly planted trees needed, but these days far fewer seedlings survive on precipitation alone. 
The dearth of rain has made it much harder for trees to grow, especially white fir and silvertip fir trees, which usually grow up to 1 foot per year but were now growing just 2 to 3 inches, according to a grower.  He also noted that the dry trees cannot produce pitch, or sap that is used to repel pests.

Since reporting is voluntary, the actual number of dry wells is likely higher than reported. 
The well failures were highest in Fresno, Madera, Tulare and Tehama counties. About 1,600 households were receiving water assistance and another couple hundred were relying on community water tanks. Some residents in the Central Valley have used water from temporary storage tanks for more than five years.

57866,6007,Record low number of winter-run Chinook salmon fry in California's Sacramento River,"A record low number of endangered winter-run Chinook salmon fry migrated down the Sacramento River this year, according to preliminary data collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at Red Bluff Diversion Dam. An estimated 158,764 fry, or baby salmon, have made it from below Keswick Dam to Red Bluff this year, compared to an average of 1.3 million winter Chinook salmon. This is the second straight year that such low numbers of Chinooks were reported. 
In 2021, an estimated 557,652 winter Chinook swam down the river to Red Bluff. Conditions were very difficult that year as the water was low and warm due to water being diverted to irrigators, resulting in massive fry mortality. 
The low numbers this year were due to fewer adult Chinooks arriving to spawn in the river, compared to 2021, and a thiamine deficiency from a diet high in anchovies.
The hatchery staff processed 16 million eggs altogether with a goal of producing 7.5 million salmon smolts, including the 1.5 million additional fish allocated for the drought.

54133,6013,Salinity barrier constructed in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California,"The Department of Water Resources finished removing the drought salinity barrier from the West False River in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta several days prior to Nov. 30. The barrier was installed in June 2021 to prevent saltwater intrusion with less fresh water from upstream reservoirs and streams flowing into the Delta during California’s continuing drought. DWR was required to remove the structure by November 30 to comply with environmental permits.  
California Department of Water Resources (Sacramento, Calif.), Nov 30, 2022

The temporary Emergency Drought Salinity Barrier that was constructed on the West False River in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in June 2021 is being notched to allow fish and boats to pass through it from January through March 2022. The barrier was originally meant to be removed by the end of November 2021, but may be removed by Nov. 30, 2022 if conditions permit. 
The barrier is designed to help slow the movement of saltwater into the central and south Delta and prevent contamination of water supplies for Delta agriculture and municipal supplies for millions of Californians who rely on Delta-based federal and state water projects for at least some of their water.
California Department of Water Resources (Sacramento, Calif.), Jan 5, 2022

The tide slowly pushes salt water further into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, nearer to pumps that send water to interior Delta cities and towns.  If salt water were to reach the pumps, they would be shut down.
Capital Public Radio (Sacramento, Calif.), July 30, 2021

Construction crews were finishing the $10 million rock barrier through a part of the Delta in Contra Costa County to protect the water supply from salt water.  The salty water was moving deeper into the Delta toward state and federal pumps that carry water south to 27 million residents from San Jose to Los Angeles and to millions of acres of farmland in the Central Valley and elsewhere.  The barrier will remain in place until the latter part of November when the rainy season brings water to push the salty water out of the Delta.
East Bay Times (San Jose, Calif.), June 22, 2021

A giant rock wall will be constructed across a river in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to protect a vital freshwater estuary from saltwater as rivers become too low to push the brackish waters from the bay.  The $30 million barrier will be built in the same place as it was in 2015 on the West False River in eastern Contra Costa County to keep saltwater away from pumping stations.  Hopefully construction can begin by June 1 and be complete by July 1.  The barrier will be removed before Nov. 30 as fall rains increase river flows.

Many birds, such as egrets, ducks, geese, hawks and eagles, are expected to do the same as wetland availability is low. The concern is that the birds will tire themselves by flying too far, increasing risk of starvation, vulnerability to disease or predators and chance of reproductive failure, risks that increase as the stress continues. Fewer migratory birds stopped last year. 
Some state and federal wildlife refuges have taken the unprecedented step of suspending hunts for waterfowl in fall and winter, or delaying the season, due to the dry conditions and difficulties that they pose for birds. The Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex, for instance, postponed its opener and lowered hunting quotas in many areas.

Oregon Public Broadcasting (Portland), June 6, 2022

Increased groundwater pumping in the Klamath Basin since late summer 2021 through early April 2022 has resulted in hundreds of domestic wells running dry.
Associated Press News (New York), April 11, 2022

There were 84 dry wells registered in Klamath County in July.  One month later, there were 185 dry wells between the California state line and Crescent and La Pine, but there are likely more.  When people register their dry wells with the watermaster, they receive water storage tanks and water deliveries from the state.  
The groundwater level in the Klamath Basin has fallen by 30 feet since 2001 and is expected to drop another 40 to 50 feet after this season.

57215,6007,Rice acreage down in Northern California,"A third year of drought means less water for Northern California and less water for rice acreage. Rice growers along the Sacramento and Feather rivers will have to leave fields idle, according to a rice farming systems adviser and director at the University of California Butte County Cooperative Extension. In Butte County, about 60% to 80% of rice acres will be planted as usual, but in Glenn and Colusa counties, just about 10% of rice will be planted, he said. Reduced water supplies in 2021 meant that there were fewer acres of rice planted last year, too.
Irrigation districts along the Feather River hold a 50% entitlement minimum according to a 1969 water diversion agreement, which Lake Oroville can provide, so 60% to 70% of rice should be planted along the Feather River. 
Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District manager stated that farmers in his district will likely plant only 2,000 acres of a total 100,000 acres of rice normally planted for just 2% of normal. While the irrigation district has a 75% water entitlement agreement, Lake Shasta does not hold enough water to fulfill the agreement. The district will get just 18% of their water rights. 
The sharp reduction in water supplies has forced some rice growers to let their employees go, increasing unemployment in the area. There will also be fewer people employed processing rice.

Residents who observe water waste can contact the district to report it. A first violation will result in a letter being sent. A fine may follow a third violation, but violators would have to egregiously overwater and blatantly refuse to obey the water rules to be fined $10,000.
The water district, however, only has three water cops for the entire county to enforce water rules.
The district’s 10 reservoirs in Santa Clara County are just 23% full.

53930,6041,Mandatory water conservation for Marin Municipal Water District in California,"The Marin Municipal Water District board unanimously approved mandatory restrictions for its 195,000 customers in south and central Marin County which would take effect on May 1.  The goal was to curb overall districtwide water use by 40%.  Certain non-essential water uses were prohibited, such as washing vehicles at home and power-washing, among other activities.  Additional irrigation restrictions will be considered in two weeks.
Mandatory restrictions are triggered when reservoir levels fall to 40,000 feet by April 1.  Reservoirs were slightly above 41,000 feet as of April 22.  Marin Water’s reservoir storage was 52%, whereas normal levels for this time of year are more than 90%.  Marin Water does not get water from the Sierra as other parts of California do.
NBC Bay Area (San Jose, Calif.), April 22, 2021

The Marin Municipal Water District proposed mandatory conservation rules for the first time since 1988 in response to historically low rainfall like that during the 1976-77 drought.  The proposed ordinance would allow outdoor watering one day per week starting May 1.  The district board of directors will vote on the ordinance on April 20.  
The North Marin Water District will consider similar mandatory conservation rules later in April.

Initial water allocations for 2022 for contractors of the Central Valley Project indicated that most irrigation districts in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys should expect to get no water this year. 
The weather has been dry since the start of the year. In the first two weeks of February, 1.2 million acre-feet of inflow for Shasta, Folsom and Oroville were lost. This year could even turn out to be worse than 2021.
Most cities will get a 25% allocation, while some will receive just enough to cover “public health and safety needs,” which means 55 gallons per person daily. Wildlife refuges should receive a 75% allocation.
In January, State Water Project customers learned that they would receive a 15% allocation.

In 2021, an estimated 9.5 million trees in California died from insects, disease and drought, according to aerial survey data from the U.S. Forest Service. Significant tree mortality occurred in Fresno and Tulare counties last year. The slopes of the Klamath, Trinity and northern Sierra ranges are dotted with dead trees after 2021—these moister areas had no dead trees just a few years ago. Siskiyou County had the most tree deaths with about 10% of the total in 2021.
Nearly two-thirds of the tree deaths from 2021 were firs and often infested with fir engraver beetles. Sugar and ponderosa pine continued to die mostly from mountain and western pine beetles. 
Seventy-five thousand trees, including acacia and eucalyptus, in the East Bay perished in 2021. Scientists think that fungi in combination with drought may have killed the trees. Many trees died at the East Bay Regional Park District’s Anthony Chabot, Reinhardt Redwood and Tilden parks.
The Dixie Fire, which burned 963,000 acres in the northern Sierra, killed more than 100 million trees by the Forest Service’s estimate. Trees killed in fires are not included in the tree mortality estimates made from the aerial surveys. 
San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Feb 28, 2022

California suffered the loss of another 18 million trees since the fall of 2017, a substantial number, but fewer than the 27 million dead trees counted in the fall of 2017 or the 62 million dead trees documented in the fall of 2016.  The return to more rainfall and less drought has helped trees resist the bark beetles that have damaged and killed so many trees.  
Since drought began in 2010, more than 147 million trees on 9.7 million acres died.  The slowing rate of tree mortality was encouraging.  
Los Angeles Times (Calif.), Feb. 11, 2019

Trees continued to die in the Sierra Nevada more than a year after the end of California’s multiyear drought.  The U.S. Forest Service reported that 27 million trees died since November 2016, bringing the total of dead trees to roughly 129 million on about 8.9 million acres of land since 2010.  The trees were stressed and dehydrated by drought, making them more vulnerable to bark beetle infestations and other ills.
The density of dead trees was so great in areas that foresters closed roads and campgrounds to protect the public from falling trees.  Views in Yosemite and Sequoia national parks were marred by the spectacle of rust-colored trees, as were some stretches along the coast.

Siskiyou County had the most tree deaths with about 10% of the total in 2021.
Nearly two-thirds of the tree deaths from 2021 were firs and often infested with fir engraver beetles. Sugar and ponderosa pine continued to die mostly from mountain and western pine beetles. 
Seventy-five thousand trees, including acacia and eucalyptus, in the East Bay perished in 2021. Scientists think that fungi in combination with drought may have killed the trees. Many trees died at the East Bay Regional Park District’s Anthony Chabot, Reinhardt Redwood and Tilden parks.
The Dixie Fire, which burned 963,000 acres in the northern Sierra, killed more than 100 million trees by the Forest Service’s estimate. Trees killed in fires are not included in the tree mortality estimates made from the aerial surveys. 
San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Feb 28, 2022

California suffered the loss of another 18 million trees since the fall of 2017, a substantial number, but fewer than the 27 million dead trees counted in the fall of 2017 or the 62 million dead trees documented in the fall of 2016.  The return to more rainfall and less drought has helped trees resist the bark beetles that have damaged and killed so many trees.  
Since drought began in 2010, more than 147 million trees on 9.7 million acres died.  The slowing rate of tree mortality was encouraging.  
Los Angeles Times (Calif.), Feb. 11, 2019

Trees continued to die in the Sierra Nevada more than a year after the end of California’s multiyear drought.  The U.S. Forest Service reported that 27 million trees died since November 2016, bringing the total of dead trees to roughly 129 million on about 8.9 million acres of land since 2010.  The trees were stressed and dehydrated by drought, making them more vulnerable to bark beetle infestations and other ills.
The density of dead trees was so great in areas that foresters closed roads and campgrounds to protect the public from falling trees.  Views in Yosemite and Sequoia national parks were marred by the spectacle of rust-colored trees, as were some stretches along the coast.

The slopes of the Klamath, Trinity and northern Sierra ranges are dotted with dead trees after 2021—these moister areas had no dead trees just a few years ago. Siskiyou County had the most tree deaths with about 10% of the total in 2021.
Nearly two-thirds of the tree deaths from 2021 were firs and often infested with fir engraver beetles. Sugar and ponderosa pine continued to die mostly from mountain and western pine beetles. 
Seventy-five thousand trees, including acacia and eucalyptus, in the East Bay perished in 2021. Scientists think that fungi in combination with drought may have killed the trees. Many trees died at the East Bay Regional Park District’s Anthony Chabot, Reinhardt Redwood and Tilden parks.
The Dixie Fire, which burned 963,000 acres in the northern Sierra, killed more than 100 million trees by the Forest Service’s estimate. Trees killed in fires are not included in the tree mortality estimates made from the aerial surveys.

The Marin Municipal Water District board voted unanimously on Feb. 15 to allow the district’s customers in central and southern Marin to use outdoor sprinklers and drip irrigation two days per week. Outdoor irrigation using tap water had been banned since Dec. 1 due to drought.
Marin Independent Journal (Calif.), Feb 16, 2022

After a number of atmospheric rivers that brought tremendous rain to Marin County, the reservoirs have refilled from 32% to 74% of capacity on Dec. 17 and water officials were reconsidering some drought restrictions and penalties that were introduced earlier.  
Since July, the Marin Municipal Water District has received about 34 inches of rain, or about 240% of normal to date. 
The utility continues to plan for water projects like the $100 million pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge that would pump in water purchased from Yuba County. The district began planning the pipeline when it appeared that its local reservoir supplies could be depleted as soon as July 2022.
The San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Dec 19, 2021

Outdoor watering was no longer permitted in Marin if water use exceeds 65 gallons of water daily for a 4-person household. The aim is to conserve 40% district wide.
Overall reservoir storage for the Marin Municipal Water District was at 58% of capacity, or 8% less than average for the date.

54053,6041,"Preparation for continued drought in Marin County, California with plans for pipeline across bridge","Thanks to abundant rainfall refilling reservoirs, the Marin Municipal Water District was no longer in a big rush to construct the $100 million pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge which would provide more water for MMWD customers if reservoirs were to run dry. The region received more than 200% of its normal rainfall from October through December, and the district’s seven reservoirs refilled from 32% of capacity in mid-October to nearly 93% in early January 2022.
Marin Independent Journal (Calif.), Jan 5, 2022

After a number of atmospheric rivers that brought tremendous rain to Marin County, the reservoirs have refilled from 32% to 74% of capacity on Dec. 17 and water officials were reconsidering some drought restrictions and penalties that were introduced earlier.  
Since July, the Marin Municipal Water District has received about 34 inches of rain, or about 240% of normal to date. 
The utility continues to plan for water projects like the $100 million pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge that would pump in water purchased from Yuba County. The district began planning the pipeline when it appeared that its local reservoir supplies could be depleted as soon as July 2022.
The San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Dec 19, 2021

More than 17 inches of desperately needed rain fell at Lake Lagunitas reservoir Oct. 18-25. The 17+ inches represents about a third of the 52 inches typically received in a year. Water supplies in the district’s seven reservoirs in the Mount Tamalpais watershed rose from 32% to 43% of total capacity, with the total storage increasing from about 25,772 acre-feet on Oct. 18 to 34,535 acre-feet on Oct. 25.
While the rain is beneficial, the Marin Municipal Water District is still planning to build the 8-mile pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge to bring in additional water.
Marin Independent Journal (Calif.), Oct 25, 2021

The Marin Municipal Water District was taking steps toward constructing an emergency water pipeline if the coming winter is dry like the last, to avoid running out of water next summer.  A consulting firm was seeking out potential water rights holders in the Central Valley that might be willing to sell their allotments.  
In the meantime, it is hoped that conservation efforts will continue to improve so the pipeline and temporary desalination plant can remain unused backup plans.  While conservation of 40% has been requested, residents conserved about 19% recently.  
The Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.), June 23, 2021

The potential for water shortages in Marin County was so high that the Marin Municipal Water District was talking with East Bay officials about building a pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge to bring water into the county if the upcoming winter shapes up to be as dry as the past two.  The emergency pipeline was once used during the 1976-77 drought.  A temporary desalination plant was another of several options under consideration to boost water supplies if the drought were to continue into a third year.  Marin only received 20 inches of rain during the winter, less than fell during the 1976-77 drought and the second least amount in the 143 years that records have been kept.  
The MMWD approved mandatory water restrictions on April 20 and could tighten restrictions further for its 190,000 customers in central and southern Marin.

The plant was not yet operating at full capacity as water was being conserved for use in the spring and summer. Water was being released at 900 cubic feet per second and was producing 30 megawatts of electricity, although the plant’s maximum capacity is 750 megawatts.

The prediction came true. An estimated 2.6% of the winter-run Chinook salmon juvenile population were able to survive the warm water temperatures, according to the CDFW. 
Another factor was at play regarding the young fish.  Many were deficient in thiamine, or vitamin B1, due to adult salmon binging on anchovies, causing a breakdown in thiamine levels, which was passed along to the juveniles. 
Environmentalists charge that the massive fish kill was caused by mismanagement of the river last spring when the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation sent hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water from Shasta Lake to farmers with special water rights.

Only 2% of winter-run Chinook juvenile salmon likely survived the summer, due to high water temperatures which led to massive fish kills in the Sacramento River, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Not even during previous years of drought have so many juvenile salmon died, raising the specter of permanent collapse of the endangered species. 
An estimated 75% of winter-run Chinook eggs died from heat this summer on the upper Sacramento River. Experts think that nearly all the remaining salmon that did hatch soon died from a combination of low river flows and natural or human-caused mortality.
Courthouse News Service (Pasadena, Calif.), Nov 4, 2021

Drought is heating up the Sacramento River to the point that nearly all endangered winter-run Chinook salmon could perish this fall, warned officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.  The salmon typically have a 3-year life cycle, so the deaths of nearly all of one year’s run of young “greatly increases the risk of extinction for the species,” according to a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

56399,6103,Warm Sacramento River water temperatures killed young salmon,"In July 2021, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife predicted that “nearly all” of the endangered Chinook salmon juvenile population would likely die from warm water in the Sacramento River in 2021. The prediction came true. An estimated 2.6% of the winter-run Chinook salmon juvenile population were able to survive the warm water temperatures, according to the CDFW. 
Another factor was at play regarding the young fish.  Many were deficient in thiamine, or vitamin B1, due to adult salmon binging on anchovies, causing a breakdown in thiamine levels, which was passed along to the juveniles. 
Environmentalists charge that the massive fish kill was caused by mismanagement of the river last spring when the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation sent hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water from Shasta Lake to farmers with special water rights.
The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Jan 3, 2022

Only 2% of winter-run Chinook juvenile salmon likely survived the summer, due to high water temperatures which led to massive fish kills in the Sacramento River, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Not even during previous years of drought have so many juvenile salmon died, raising the specter of permanent collapse of the endangered species. 
An estimated 75% of winter-run Chinook eggs died from heat this summer on the upper Sacramento River. Experts think that nearly all the remaining salmon that did hatch soon died from a combination of low river flows and natural or human-caused mortality.
Courthouse News Service (Pasadena, Calif.), Nov 4, 2021

Drought is heating up the Sacramento River to the point that nearly all endangered winter-run Chinook salmon could perish this fall, warned officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.  The salmon typically have a 3-year life cycle, so the deaths of nearly all of one year’s run of young “greatly increases the risk of extinction for the species,” according to a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council.  
California’s last drought also caused two years of severe mortality among winter-run salmon.

California produces 80% of the world’s almonds and has a $6 billion almond industry, but the lack of water is forcing almond growers to make hard decisions about whether to continue growing them as some almond orchards were planted in areas with unreliable water supplies.

California produces 80% of the world’s almonds and has a $6 billion almond industry, but the lack of water is forcing almond growers to make hard decisions about whether to continue growing them as some almond orchards were planted in areas with unreliable water supplies.

California’s hydropower generating capacity has dropped by about 1,000 megawatts, due to drought, per the California Public Utilities Commission.
Los Angeles Times, July 21, 2021

The Edward Hyatt Power Plant at Lake Oroville likely has enough water to continue producing hydropower for another two to three months before the water level is expected to fall too low for further power production, according to a California Energy Commission spokesperson.  The hydroelectric power plant, the fourth largest energy producer in California, has never closed before since it began operation in 1967, but its production was 20% of total capacity as water levels fall.  The present water level was near 700 feet above sea level, but power generation would end at 640 feet.

The district mandated a 40% collective reduction in water use, compared with 2018-2020, but conservation has only reached 21%.  A water pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge could be needed as an emergency supply project to keep water flowing next summer if the coming winter is dry.

54000,6001,Drought emergency in 50 counties in California,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom included another nine counties in the emergency drought proclamation that encompasses 50 of the state's 58 counties.  The nine counties were Inyo, Marin, Mono, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz.
Associated Press News (New York), July 8, 2021

California Gov. Gavin Newsom included another 39 counties in his drought emergency declaration, which originally included only Sonoma and Mendocino counties. No mandatory drought water conservation targets were ordered, as was done during the previous drought, because Californians were using 16% less water than they did in 2013 as conservation had become a habit.
Newsom will also request $5.1 billion over the next four years, including $1 billion to help low-income residents pay overdue water bills, $1.3 billion for upgrades to drinking water systems and funds for groundwater projects, canal repairs and fish restoration projects.
Warm temperatures melted the Sierra Nevada snowpack quickly, which was only 59% of historical average on April 1.  Much of the runoff soaked into the dry soil rather than refilling reservoirs, which consequently hold 500,000 acre-feet less than was anticipated, enough water for 1 million households.  
The Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.), May 10, 2021

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared drought emergency in Mendocino and Sonoma counties as they deal with “substantial water supply and ecosystem challenges.”  State officials were directed to work with local water suppliers to conserve more water. 
Lake Mendocino was at about 43% capacity, and Lake Sonoma was about 62% full.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom included another 39 counties in his drought emergency declaration, which originally included only Sonoma and Mendocino counties. No mandatory drought water conservation targets were ordered, as was done during the previous drought, because Californians were using 16% less water than they did in 2013 as conservation had become a habit.
Newsom will also request $5.1 billion over the next four years, including $1 billion to help low-income residents pay overdue water bills, $1.3 billion for upgrades to drinking water systems and funds for groundwater projects, canal repairs and fish restoration projects.
Warm temperatures melted the Sierra Nevada snowpack quickly, which was only 59% of historical average on April 1.  Much of the runoff soaked into the dry soil rather than refilling reservoirs, which consequently hold 500,000 acre-feet less than was anticipated, enough water for 1 million households.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared drought emergency in Mendocino and Sonoma counties as they deal with “substantial water supply and ecosystem challenges.”  State officials were directed to work with local water suppliers to conserve more water. 
Lake Mendocino was at about 43% capacity, and Lake Sonoma was about 62% full.

Rainfall was a record low during the past winter, leading Marin water suppliers to impose mandatory water restrictions.  The county intends to request to be added to the list of 41 California counties already in an emergency drought declaration.
Water sources have gone dry months earlier than normal for many dairy and beef cattle ranchers, particularly in the West Marin area.  Supplemental hay and feed was needed months earlier, also as pasture quality was poor.  The McClure Dairy, the oldest one on the Point Reyes National Seashore, closed and more may follow.  Roughly 50% of the county’s 300 acres of crop production may be fallowed, due to drought.
The North Marin Water District enacted a temporary ban on new water connections. The Marin Municipal Water District board intends to also consider a temporary ban on new water meter connections.

The ranch’s single spring was historically abundant, but was no longer recharging.  Grass was growing more slowly, forcing the purchase of feed.  A glut of organic milk meant prices were down.

Having water for frost protection is also a big concern for vineyards as frost can be a threat through the latter part of May.  Farm reservoirs were low, offering little for irrigation or frost protection.  Another water-conserving measure one vineyard took was to mow off the cover crops between the vines so there was less competition for rain that might fall. 
Dairy ranchers fear grasslands will turn brown earlier than usual, have sold cattle and were already trucking water for livestock.  Vegetable farmers have adjusted cropping plans to grow vegetables that will offer the largest yield while using less water.  Cannabis growers’ well water use is metered under a specific cap, barely allowing them enough water to get a crop.

54040,6095,Young salmon in California being trucked to sea,"Tanker trucks were being used to transport about 16.8 million young salmon from four Central Valley hatcheries to the San Francisco Bay and other coastal sites  as drought left rivers too low, too warm or both for the smolts’ survival.  About 20% more fish than normal were being trucked to the Pacific Ocean.  The aim is to maximize survival of California’s fall-run chinook, central to the state’s commercial and recreational salmon industries.  
The chinook typically start their lives upriver and swim to the Pacific Ocean, where they stay for three years until they return to where they were born to spawn.

Other large water agencies in the Bay Area were similarly asking customers to conserve, but were not yet taking a tougher approach.  The SCVWD, serving 2 million people in the Silicon Valley, will make the decision on future restrictions by May and will be seeking to purchase water from other parts of the state to bolster its supplies.  
The district’s 10 reservoirs were 16% full on March 16. The Sierra Nevada snowpack was 61% of normal. Most Bay Area cities received only about 40% of the historic average rainfall this winter.
The SCVWD’s largest reservoir, Anderson Reservoir, was drained last year over federal regulators’ concerns that the dam could collapse if a major earthquake occurred.

A historically warm, dry February raised the likelihood of a difficult fire season in California.  In Mendocino National Park in northern California, U.S. Forest Service crews were trying to extinguish a blaze burning through timber.  
State firefighters have battled 280 small fires, compared to just 85 by this time last year.  In a rare February event, the U.S. Forest Service put out a fire at the 4,000 level where snow ought to cover the landscape at this time of year.
