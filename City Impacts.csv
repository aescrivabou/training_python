58142,06-33056,"Drought contributed to losses to water, wastewater and electric funds in Healdsburg, California","Water and wastewater revenues in Healdsburg were sharply reduced this year, due to mandatory reductions in water use to conserve water. The financial shortfall led the city to freeze two vacant Utility and Public Works positions and defer infrastructure maintenance. As of March 31, the end of the third quarter, both funds were behind in revenue, down 10% to date, for a combined $1.09 million loss over projections through that period. To compensate for the shortfalls, spending from the water fund was cut by about $251,000, while spending from the wastewater fund was reduced by about $9,600 for fiscal year 2023-24. Maintenance will be delayed on water fountains, distribution pipes and pumps. 
Healdsburg operates its own electric utility, which also suffered a shortfall. The electric fund was down by 6% to $9.01 million through the third quarter.

The California Department of Water Resources announced an expected water allocation of 35% from the State Water Project, up from 30% in January. 
The Associated Press (New York), Feb 22, 2023

The series of storms that brought heavy rain and snow to California have partially filled reservoirs, allowing the State Water Project to offer 30% of requested water supplies to 29 public water agencies that serve 27 million Californians. The initial allocation in December was just 5%.
California typically receives half its rain and snow by the end of January. Water managers will reassess conditions monthly during the winter and spring, and also consider snowpack data and runoff forecasts from February on.

Jan 26, 2023

The Department of Water Resources announced an initial State Water Project allocation of 5 percent of requested supplies for 2023. The SWP provides water to 29 public water agencies that serve 27 million Californians. Water allocations are frequently low early in the wet season due to uncertainty in hydrologic forecasting. In addition, the expectation is for a fourth dry year and continued drought in California. Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the State Water Project system, is just 55% of average for this time of year. Oroville ended Water Year 2022 at about 400,000 acre-feet higher than the previous year. 
For the 2022 Water Year, the initial allocation was 0% on Dec. 1, 2021, with limited water designated only for any unmet human health and safety needs. Last year’s final allocation was 5 percent plus unmet health and safety needs. Four of the 29 State Water Contractors ultimately requested and received additional health and safety water supply.

57952,06-04030,"Bobcats hunting, killing small dogs on military bases in California’s High Desert","Bobcats have been hunting and killing small dogs in backyards at Fort Irwin and at other military bases in California’s High Desert over the past four months. The base has secured a “depredation permit” to capture or kill the wild lynx. A fatal bobcat attack on Feb. 4 was the fifth known case since Oct. 5 of a bobcat or multiple bobcats attacking small, unsupervised dogs weighing less than 30 pounds. 
This is an “extremely rare and unusual” change in bobcat behavior, with no such attacks being reported in recent years. Fort Irwin officials theorize that the attacks may be related to drought limiting the bobcat’s natural prey, such as squirrels and kangaroo rats.

57938,06-59920,Drought contributed to the deaths of 36.3 million trees in California in 2022,"Tree mortality in California rose to about 36.3 million trees in 2022, due to drought, insects and disease, per the U.S. Forest Service. In 2021, 9.5 million trees died. From mid-July to early October, researchers surveyed almost 40 million acres of federal, state and private land. They found dead trees spread across 2.6 million acres.
The biggest increase in tree mortality was seen in Douglas fir trees. Three million dead Douglas firs were observed, an increase of 1,650%, counted across 190,000 acres, mostly in the central Sierra Nevada Range. 
There were 12 million dead white fir trees, an increase of 691%, across 1.5 million acres, and 15 million dead red firs, an increase of 242%, across 890,000 acres. The dead trees were clustered mainly around the Northern California city of Redding, also in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and surrounding areas.
Other years with high tree mortality rates were 2016 with nearly 62 million dead trees, 2017 with 27 million trees and 2019 with 15 million dead trees. 
The main cause of the tree mortality is drought, as about 80% of the state endured severe drought since the start of 2022, per the U.S. Drought Monitor.

This is the second straight year that such low numbers of Chinooks were reported. 
In 2021, an estimated 557,652 winter Chinook swam down the river to Red Bluff. Conditions were very difficult that year as the water was low and warm due to water being diverted to irrigators, resulting in massive fry mortality. 
The low numbers this year were due to fewer adult Chinooks arriving to spawn in the river, compared to 2021, and a thiamine deficiency from a diet high in anchovies.

Other water agencies were asking up to $5,000 per acre-foot. 
Coalinga normally buys its water from the federal government at $130 per acre-foot, but the Bureau of Reclamation cut water supplies to most San Joaquin Valley irrigators, due to drought.
The Fresno Bee (Calif.), Oct 28, 2022

Coalinga could run out of water by December. Supplying the town with water from elsewhere will be very costly as officials estimated that water purchased from private vendors would increase the cost from $133,000 to $1.3 million for the same amount of water.
Drought also causes an illness called Valley Fever, which comes from breathing in soil fungus.

56836,06-06434,Slow start to winter led to a snow drought in the Western U.S.,"Snowpack in the Western U.S. was lagging as warm temperatures and lack of precipitation contributed to the snow drought.
Denver broke its 87-year-old measurable snowfall record originally set on Nov. 21, 1934 and is approaching an 1887 record of 235 consecutive days without snow.
This is only the second time since 1976 that Salt Lake City has gone snowless through November. Several ski resorts, including Powder Mountain and Snowbasin near Ogden, have not yet opened due to the absence of snow.
In western Wyoming, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort opened on Thanksgiving, thanks to manmade snow on a small number of low-elevation runs and in an area for children and other inexperienced skiers. The upper mountain will open once natural snow falls.
Most ski resorts in the Rockies are eagerly awaiting snow to open. To be on the safe side, Breckenridge will hold its annual festival in honor of Ullr, the Norse God of Snow and the Patron Saint of Skiers. The four-day event will begin on Dec. 9.

56818,06-86972,Initial allocation of 0% for California's State Water Project customers,"California cities and farms should not expect to receive water from California’s State Water Project (SWP) in 2022, announced the state officials. This is the earliest date that the Department of Water Resources has announced a 0% water allocation, indicative of just how serious drought conditions are as reservoirs plunge to record low levels. Mandatory restrictions will be put in place if the winter dryness persists. 
Twenty-nine water districts in California typically request water from the SWP. Partial allocations are delivered, depending on snowfall and reservoir storage. The initial allocation in December 2020 was 10% and was reduced to 5% in March 2021. 
Seven districts that requested water will get some of the roughly 340,000 acre-feet to be divvied this year among the districts for critical health and safety needs, like fire suppression. The Metropolitan Water District in Southern California, providing water for about 19 million people, will receive some water. The system was intended to deliver more than 4.2 million acre-feet.
Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide drought emergency in October and urged water conservation.
